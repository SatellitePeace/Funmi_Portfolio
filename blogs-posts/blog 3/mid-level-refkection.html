            Hey, it's been a minute on here. Lately, I’ve been asking myself questions I believe many career-driven folks just like me wrestle with.
            Am I growing or just doing what I need to do to get by? Is this still the right space for me?
            Should I keep riding the wave or start looking for a new passion? I recently achieved a major
             milestone in my career. And as proud as I am, I couldn’t help but ask: Now what?, What next? 😣 
        </p>
        <p class="details">
            In a rapidly shifting world, thanks to AI, the pressure to keep moving, learning, and staying relevant is louder than ever. But when is it okay to just you know… rest?
            As a PM, I am focused on chasing outcomes, milestones, successful launches, and user value. But what about personal value? When is the right time to say:
            “I’ve learned enough here, time to grow elsewhere.” vs.“It’s okay to sit still for a while and just be present.”
        </p>
        <p class="details">
          Now, I am sure you can agree with me that, while developers write or develop the AI codes, 
          Product Managers can contribute their own quota by making open source projects actually 
          succeed by focusing on people, and not just the technology. This matters even more now with 
          AI reshaping and automating everything.

            I guess there’s no one-size-fits-all answer after all. But maybe what I am seeking is awareness. Being honest with oneself about your learning curve, your impact, and your alignment with your current team and the product.
            Today, I chose to remind myself that;
        </p>
           <ol class="story-points">
             <li>
                I am not being left behind.
            </li>
             <li>
                Rest is not stagnation.
             </li>
             <li>
                And sometimes, staying is the boldest move I can make.
             </li>
           </ol>
           <p class="details">
            To every PM out there navigating these thoughts, you’re not alone. 
            🫂 ❤️
