         Kolapo I (https://www.linkedin.com/in/kolapoimam/) recently asked an intriguing question on X that inspired this post: 
          'What are some of the most realistic ways Product Managers can contribute to Open Source?' 
          (https://lnkd.in/dApzHTUv). 
        </p>
        <p class="details">This thought-provoking question is not only critical for Product Managers 
          but also has the potential to shape our relevance in today‚Äôs tech world.
        </p>
        <p class="details">
          Now, I am sure you can agree with me that, while developers write or develop the AI codes, 
          Product Managers can contribute their own quota by making open source projects actually 
          succeed by focusing on people, and not just the technology. This matters even more now with 
          AI reshaping and automating everything.
        </p>
        <h3>To-Do:</h3>
           <ol class="story-points">
             <li>User Research: Let's put ourselves in the shoes of the users and actually talk to them, 
              understand their problems, and make sure the project solves their problems. Simple as 
              asking "What's frustrating you?" and fixing it. PS: Lamide Akomolafe did the lord's 
              work and built this simple to use AI research tool for PMs, you should check it out 
              here https://coverage.work/
            </li>
             <li>
            Set Clear Cut Product Direction: Sort through the mess of overload feature requests. 
              "EVERYTHING IS NOT A PRIORITY", decide what matters the most, just like you'd prioritize 
              fixing a leaky roof before painting the walls of your room.
             </li>
             <li>
            Build Community: While collaborating, also create a welcoming space where your co-workers 
              or as we know it cross-functional team members would want to contribute. Think of it like 
              hosting a dinner party where everyone brings something to the table.
             </li>
             <li>
            Make the Solution Usable üòê: Partner with your designers to turn complex product 
              solutions into something your grandmother could use. Remember how confusing Netflix 
              was before they simplified it? Exactly!!ü§ó
             </li>
           </ol>
           <h3>PMs AI Mission:</h3>
           <ul class="story-points-2">
            <li>Ensure AI tools solve real problems.</li>
            <li>Keep development ethical.</li>
            <li>Make complex technology accessible</li>
           </ul>
           <h3>Bottom Line:</h3>
           <p class="details">
            Open source needs more than just code - it needs PMs who understand people. 
            We're not just building technology; we're building technology that works for us 
            and the human population at large. 
           </p>
              <p class="details">
                What do you think? How else can PMs contribute to open source? Let‚Äôs keep the 
                conversation going‚Äîthe future‚Äôs waiting for us to shape it.
